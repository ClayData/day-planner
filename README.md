# day-planner
https://claydata.github.io/day-planner/

This day planner was built using jQuery and Bootstrap. It displays the hours of an average working day (9-5), and allows the user to add events into it. Every hour that has not yet happened in a day will have a green background, the current will be gray and the hours that have passed will be in red. The user may lock in the events with the lock button next to that hours text box. Hitting this button saves the text to local storage so that the text will still appear on the screen when you return to the webpage at a later time. There is a refresh button on the bottom of the page to refresh all of the boxes.
